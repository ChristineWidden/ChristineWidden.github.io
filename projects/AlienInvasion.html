                <p>Alien invasion is a Unity-based tower defense game, written in C#. It was developed alongside
                    Caroline White, Giovanni Librizzi, Kaydee Tu, and Thomas Panyasrivinit.</p>

                <p>In addition to assisting with finding, making, and importing assets, level design, and playtesting, I
                    primarily worked on the tower upgrade system.</p>
                <p>Keeping in mind the possibility that if we were to continue developing the game past the conclusion
                    of the course, we may want to add quite a few different towers, I sought to make the tower upgrade
                    system as modular as possible through the use of object-oriented programming.</p>
